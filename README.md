# Autonomous Parking Planning
This work is about planning the trajectory for autonoumous vehicles in the parking sceniro. The vehicle movement is based the reeds-shepp curve and the planning algorithm is the hybrid A* algorithm. And we show you two parking scenes, parallel parking and backward parking.\n
## The reeds-shepp curve
The reeds-shepp curve is the basic movement for bicycle model vehicles in the obstacle free environment. It's usually used in the movement unit in the motion planning problem.
## The A* and hybrid A* algorithm
